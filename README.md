# EnlightenGAN-Image_Enhancer
Very minimalistic wrapper for EnlightenGAN inference. It uses carefully converted pretrained weights (+ baked in preprocessing) from the original repo and only requires onnxruntime as inference engine.
# Installation
pip install git+https://github.com/arsenyinfo/EnlightenGAN-inference
